# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To begin interpreting user needs there must be an initial form of communication to establish what the user requires. Then, clarifying questions should be asked to clear up any vague details. Consistent communication should be had with the customer throughout the development process to ensure all requests are implemented correctly. User stories help with this in a number of ways. One way user stories help is by keeping the specific details of what the user wants clear and documented. This is a great benefit because it helps mitigate the likelihood of miscommunication. Another benefit of user stories is that it ensures the customer islistened to and acknowledged. This is great for promoting the aspect of customer-centricity, which is a critical aspect of agile.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The first step I take in developing a program is creating a plan for what I want the project to be and what I want the project to do. In this plan should be an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) which establishes the bare minimum requirements for the project to be successful. The plan should also contain a list of tasks to complete, to help with tracking progress. I would then begin working on completing those tasks one by one. I would also make sure to take note of any issues, or potential issues, so that they can be addressed later on. I would make sure to complete the MVP goal first, and then work towards total completion, if time allows. Once the project is complete I would review and make sure everything is working properly. An agile process I would like to implement into my future work would be customer-centricity. Customer-centricity is highly important to creating software that is appealing to the people using it. Another Agile process I would like to implement is the use of the daily scrum. This would be great when working with a team to gather feedback and compare progress with my teammates.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member is highly important and relies on a number of characteristics. One aspect of a good team member is the ability to work well with others. This is probably the most important characteristic, as even a skilled worker can cause severe problems in a project, if they don't work well with their teammates. Another characteristic a good team member should have is the ability to think critically, and solve problems. It is rare to complete a software project without running into something unexpected. This is why it is important for any team member to be able to think out of the box, and come up with creative solutions to problems. Then, of course, any good team member should have a base level of technical competence.
